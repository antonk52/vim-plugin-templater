# vim-plugin-templater

Why bother remembering all the things to get right for a vim plugin?

## Demo
## Installation
## Usage

This plugin provides 2 commands

`:CreateVimPlugin` - asks questions and creates files for a plugin using vimscript that would work in both vim and neovim
`:CreateNeovimPlugin` - asks questions and creates files for plugin using lua that would work only in neovim

## TODO

- [ ] `:CreateRemotePlugin`
- [ ] `:CreateCocNvimPlugin`
- [ ] github issues template
- [ ] github PR template
- [ ] github action for linting
